                          Counselling: home economics counselling is given informally and is aimed at developing every family member within the family’s income and their physical, mental and intellectual abilities. Individuals, organizations and associations are provided with information by means of projects and demonstrations, posters, audio-visual aids, pictures, pamphlets, placards, cookbooks, etc.

                          Journalism: the press, radio and television offer interesting opportunities for a person who is original and creative. The home economist may become a journalist on a full-time, part-time or freelance basis. Many home economists write books or columns for newspapers and magazines.

                          Home economists work in a very large variety of work settings. The actual setting is determined by the type, size, location and financial resources of the employer, and by the speciality, experience and education of the home economist. Some positions require evening work and extensive travel.

                      Product design is all about creating new three-dimensional products through an efficient process of idea generation, development and evaluation.

                    <p>
                      Product designers have an understanding of the relationship between art, science and technology, and have the ability to exploit each of these things in different ways to create new products.

                    <p>
                      Good design is the backbone of our everyday lives. Product innovations can radically alter the way we are able to carry out simple daily tasks. On a higher level, new designs can change the way we interact with the environment, influence our social experiences or even save lives.

                      A career in product design offers you an opportunity to make a real impact. The process of nurturing a design, from the early concept stages to a commercially viable solution suitable for mass manufacture, can also give product designers a great amount of job satisfaction.

                    <p>
                      Product design careers cover an extremely broad spectrum of industries. Consequently, the emphasis on technical or aesthetic design expertise can vary from role to role. More technical projects will demand a greater understanding of engineering, where function may dictate form. More artistic projects are likely to focus on form and usability.

                      Product design requires a great deal of understanding of both                       materials and manufacturing techniques. A product designer will                       be expected to stay aware of new developments in these fields,                      as this will aid them in their daily work and drive innovation                      in their company.
