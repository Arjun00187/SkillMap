                              Information technology (IT) involves the use of computers, storage and networking devices to create, process, store, share and secure electronic data. It is a fast-growing field, due largely to the high demand for IT services across all industries.
                              IT degree programs prepare students to earn potentially lucrative salaries while working for IT departments and consulting firms. The median annual wage for IT careers was $81,430 in May 2015, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, considerably higher than that for all occupations.

                                Information technology degree programs vary widely depending on the institution issuing the credential. From traditional colleges and universities to accredited online and distance learning degree programs, educational opportunities are available to suit nearly any budget or schedule. Some schools offer certificate courses in specialized areas of information technology. Others offer associate, bachelor’s,
                                 or master’s degree programs designed to produce well-rounded students with broad-based knowledge in many different areas of information technology.

An online program could be a good choice if you want to enroll in a school that is far away, but not move from where you live. In fact, online information technology degrees come in many different shapes and sizes. These include hybrid programs,
                                which are a blend of campus-based and distance learning courses, fully online programs, accelerated online options and even joint degree programs. Most online information technology degree programs also use an interactive learning management system that allows you to submit assignments, ask questions and have discussions with other students.

                            Engineering is the application of science and maths to solve problems. Engineers figure out how things work and use for scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get credit for innovations that advance human condition, but it is the engineers who are instrumental in making these innovatons available to the global population. Engineering is one of the corner stones of STEM(science, technology, engineering, mathematics) education, an interdisciplinary curriculum designed to motivate students to learn about the evolving world. A career in engineering requires continual professional development to remain relevant and effective in today's rapidly changing global society. There are currently more than 15 million engineers across various disciplines worldwide and with the surge in technological advancements and preparedness, anyone can be a part of it.

                              Engineering spreads over multiple fields such as bio-engineering to the more common mechanical engineering courses. Engineering is a hands-on course that relies more on practicality and not theory based studies. However, engineering optons such as software engineering offer the rare pleasure of being a mind based field where traditional college institutions as well as highly-acclaimed online programmes strive to provide high grade content and knowledge. All is not lost though, since engineering favours both the active and passive. An engineering degree takes upto tho 5 years to acquire whereas the masters and PhDs take 2 years each.

                              To successfully design and engineer solutions for today's and tomorrow's rapidly changing and expanding global contexts, in which people are confronted with new opportunities and challenges each day, engineering programs should be training their students to become broad based professionals, who are aware of the actual needs, values and behaviors of the people that use their solutions in their everyday life, work or play. This paper argues that in order to built such an awareness, engineering students should acquire direct, first-hand experiences of real people in real contexts. It presents a number of techniques that can be used to gain such experiences.

                              Engineering opens a learner up to greater heights with the right skills and mindset. It is important to point out that engieering experiences an influx of aspiring students each and every year making it a highly competitive field where the resilient and committed survive to emerge on top. However, don not forget to have fun while you are at it. The field enables you to interact with new technology and people with various banks of knowledge to offer in your journey  from an amateur aspirant to a fully-fledged engineer and put you well above most in the job market, let alone equip you with skills to solve some of the world's problems.
